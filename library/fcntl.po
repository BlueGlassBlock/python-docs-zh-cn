"All functions in this module take a file descriptor *fd* as their first "
"argument.  This can be an integer file descriptor, such as returned by "
"``sys.stdin.fileno()``, or an :class:`io.IOBase` object, such as "
"``sys.stdin`` itself, which provides a :meth:`~io.IOBase.fileno` that "
"returns a genuine file descriptor."

":meth:`~io.IOBase.fileno`，可返回一个真正的文件描述符。"

"Perform the operation *cmd* on file descriptor *fd* (file objects providing "
"a :meth:`~io.IOBase.fileno` method are accepted as well).  The values used "
"for *cmd* are operating system dependent, and are available as constants in "
"the :mod:`fcntl` module, using the same names as used in the relevant C "
"header files. The argument *arg* can either be an integer value, or a "
":class:`bytes` object. With an integer value, the return value of this "
"function is the integer return value of the C :c:func:`fcntl` call.  When "
"the argument is bytes it represents a binary structure, e.g. created by "
":func:`struct.pack`. The binary data is copied to a buffer whose address is "
"passed to the C :c:func:`fcntl` call.  The return value after a successful "
"call is the contents of the buffer, converted to a :class:`bytes` object. "
"The length of the returned object will be the same as the length of the "
"*arg* argument. This is limited to 1024 bytes. If the information returned "
"in the buffer by the operating system is larger than 1024 bytes, this is "
"most likely to result in a segmentation violation or a more subtle data "
"corruption."
msgstr ""
"对文件描述符 *fd* 执行 *cmd* 操作（能够提供 :meth:`~io.IOBase.fileno` 方法的文件对象也可以接受）。 *cmd* "
"可用的值与操作系统有关，在 :mod:`fcntl` 模块中可作为常量使用，名称与相关 C 语言头文件中的一样。参数 *arg* 可以是整数或 "
":class:`bytes` 对象。若为整数值，则本函数的返回值是 C 语言  :c:func:`fcntl` "
"调用的整数返回值。若为字节串，则其代表一个二进制结构，比如由 :func:`struct.pack` "
"创建的数据。该二进制数据将被复制到一个缓冲区，缓冲区地址传给 C 调用 :c:func:`fcntl`。调用成功后的返回值位于缓冲区内，转换为一个 "
":class:`bytes` 对象。返回的对象长度将与 *arg* 参数的长度相同。上限为 1024 字节。如果操作系统在缓冲区中返回的信息大于 "
"1024 字节，很可能导致内存段冲突，或更为不易察觉的数据错误。"
