"The :mod:`email` package's prime focus is the handling of email messages as "
"described by the various email and MIME RFCs.  However, the general format "
"of email messages (a block of header fields each consisting of a name "
"followed by a colon followed by a value, the whole block followed by a blank"
" line and an arbitrary 'body'), is a format that has found utility outside "
"of the realm of email.  Some of these uses conform fairly closely to the "
"main email RFCs, some do not.  Even when working with email, there are times"
" when it is desirable to break strict compliance with the RFCs, such as "
"generating emails that interoperate with email servers that do not "
"themselves follow the standards, or that implement extensions you want to "
"use in ways that violate the standards."

":mod:`email` 的主要焦点是按照各种电子邮件和 MIME RFC 的描述来处理电子邮件消息。 "
"但是电子邮件消息的基本格式（一个由名称加冒号加值的标头字段构成的区块，后面再加一个空白行和任意的‘消息体’）是在电子邮件领域以外也获得应用的格式。 "
"这些应用的规则有些与主要电子邮件 RFC 十分接近，有些则很不相同。 即使是操作电子邮件，有时也可能需要打破严格的 RFC "
"规则，例如生成可与某些并不遵循标准的电子邮件服务器互联的电子邮件，或者是实现希望应用某些破坏标准的操作方式的扩展。"
