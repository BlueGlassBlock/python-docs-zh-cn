"An executable line in a :file:`.pth` file is run at every Python startup, "
"regardless of whether a particular module is actually going to be used. Its "
"impact should thus be kept to a minimum. The primary intended purpose of "
"executable lines is to make the corresponding module(s) importable (load "
"3rd-party import hooks, adjust :envvar:`PATH` etc). Any other initialization"
" is supposed to be done upon a module's actual import, if and when it "
"happens. Limiting a code chunk to a single line is a deliberate measure to "
"discourage putting anything more complex here."
msgstr ""
"每次启动 Python，在 :file:`.pth` 文件中的可执行行都将会被运行，而不管特定的模块实际上是否需要被使用。 "
"因此，其影响应降至最低。可执行行的主要预期目的是使相关模块可导入（加载第三方导入钩子，调整 :envvar:`PATH` "
"等）。如果它发生了，任何其他的初始化都应当在模块实际导入之前完成。将代码块限制为一行是一种有意采取的措施，不鼓励在此处放置更复杂的内容。"
